= Blocking and non-blocking I/O
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can use libraries in various ways with respect to I/O and application models.

The library is designed internally to use non-blocking I/O.
In the simpler use cases, however, the [.api]`lcb_wait()` function is used to block the application while it awaits the completion of pending operations.
When the [.api]`lcb_wait()` function is called the library will start its internal _event loop_ and keep the event loop running (and blocking the application) until all pending requests have been completed.
A pending request is the result of a scheduling operation (such as [.api]`lcb_get()` or [.api]`lcb_connect()`).
