= Compatibility of Couchbase Features, Couchbase Versions and the Couchbase C (libcouchbase) SDK
:navtitle: Compatibility

== API Styles and versions

Since the first release of libcouchbase 2.x in November 2012, we have added, in a compatible way, newer APIs to allow a faster and more efficient programming model.
There are two broad categories of APIs in the library, one is known as _api2_ and the other is known as _api3_.

API2 is the original C 2.0 API, and is available in all versions of libcouchbase, but is considered *deprecated* since version 2.6.0.
It looks something like this:

.API2 - Scheduling
[source,c]
----
lcb_get_cmd_t gcmd = { 0 };
lcb_get_cmd_t* gcmd_p = &gcmd;
gcmd.version = 0;
gcmd.v.v0.key = "key";
gcmd.v.v0.nkey = nkey;
lcb_get(instance, cookie, 1, &gcmd);
lcb_wait(instance);
----

.API2 - Callback
[source,c]
----
lcb_set_get_callback(get_callback);

void get_callback(lcb_t instance, const void *cookie, lcb_error_t err, const lcb_resp_get_t *resp)
{
    if (err) {
        // ...
    } else {
        printf("Value is: %.*s\n", (int)resp->v.v0.nbytes, resp->v.v0.bytes);
    }
}
----

API3 is available since version 2.5.6 (but see note below) and offers a more concise way of performing operations:

.API3 - Scheduling
[source,c]
----
lcb_CMDGET gcmd = { 0 };
LCB_CMD_SET_KEY(&gcmd, "key", 3);
lcb_get3(instance, cookie, &gcmd);
----

.API3 - Callback
[source,c]
----
lcb_install_callback(instance, LCB_CALLBACK_GET, (lcb_RESPCALLBACK)get_callback);

void get_callback(lcb_t instance, int cbtype, const lcb_RESPGET *resp)
{
    if (resp->rc) {
        //
    } else {
        printf("Value is: %.*s\n", (int)resp->nvalue, resp->value);
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
While API3 is available from version 2.4.0, the above example will only work from version 2.5.6, although it will compile on any version.
Versions prior to 2.5.6 require _explicit scheduling_ to be used in the application.
Explicit scheduling requires invoking [.api]`lcb_sched_enter()` and [.api]`lcb_sched_leave()` around any code scheduling operations.
Therefore the above snippet will work in version 2.4.0 and higher by using the following:

[source,c]
----
lcb_sched_enter(instance);
lcb_get3(instance, cookie, &gcmd);
lcb_sched_leave(instance);
----

It is recommended to upgrade to _api3_.
Internally the older _api2_ implementation is simply a wrapper around _api3_, and _api3_ provides more concise code.
Newer APIs and couchbase features will be added to _api3_ but not _api2_.
Here are some things to keep in mind when porting:

* You can mix and match callback and scheduling styles.
This means that you can use [.api]`lcb_get3` together with [.api]`lcb_set_get_callback`, or [.api]`lcb_get` with [.api]`lcb_install_callback3`.
* API3 allows you to have a single callback function that handles multiple operation types (refer to xref:document-operations.adoc[CRUD Document Operations using the C (libcouchbase) SDK with Couchbase Server]), so you can consolidate multiple `lcb_set_operation_callback` into a single _API3_ callback.
* If you are using a version of libcouchbase prior to 2.5.6, be sure to invoke [.api]`lcb_sched_leave` _before_ [.api]`lcb_wait` (or before returning to the event loop, for non-blocking applications).
Calling [.api]`lcb_sched_leave` is no longer required as of version 2.5.6
* There is no explicit batching API in _api3_.
If you wish to schedule multiple operations, simply invoke the relevant scheduling API (e.g.
`lcb_operation3()`) multiple times, once for each set of input.
* The memory ownership model and callback semantics are the same for both API versions.
This means that key and value buffers provided to the library are copied into the library's buffers.
Likewise this means that buffers received via callbacks are owned by the library's internal buffers.

== Feature Compatibility

To take advantage of all features offered by Couchbase Server, you need to know what version of the client provides compatibility for the features you want to use.
The following matrix shows which versions of the C SDK client support the major features of each version of Couchbase Server.
