= Client command-line tools

[abstract]
Some command line utilities are available as an optional add-on with the C client library.
These tools provide quick and common access to cluster operations without requiring you to write code.

The C library contains several command line tools in its source repository.
When distributed in binary form, they are available as an add-on package on Linux (`libcouchbase2-bin`).
They come bundled with the default packages on OS X and Windows.

NOTE: The C client tools are distinct from the Couchbase Server command-line tools that are available with the server installation

The tools use the C SDK internally and thus function similarly in many respects to other libraries built on top of the C SDK.
The full reference documentation is available in the API reference in HTML format and as standard Unix man pages (where applicable).
